      <div class="card span-6">
        <h3>Who do I contact for maintenance issues?</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Submit a maintenance request through the housing system/portal. If it’s urgent,
          notify staff immediately.
        </p>

      <div class="card span-6">
        <h3>What counts as an emergency maintenance issue?</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Flooding, no heat/AC in extreme weather, strong electrical burning smell, serious leaks,
          or anything that risks safety.
        </p>
        <div class="tip">
          Tip: If it’s a safety risk, don’t wait — report it immediately.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card span-6">
        <h3>What are quiet hours?</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Quiet hours are enforced during designated times. Even outside quiet hours,
          be respectful (especially late night / early morning).
        </p>
        <div class="tip">
          Tip: Headphones + low bass = you’ll never have problems.

      </div>

      <div class="card span-6">
        <h3>Can I have guests?</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Guests are usually allowed within housing guidelines, but residents are responsible
          for guest behavior and follow all building policies.
        </p>
        <div class="tip">
          Tip: If a guest causes issues, it still falls back on the resident.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card span-6">
        <h3>Who do I call in an emergency?</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Call <strong>911</strong> for immediate emergencies. You can also contact UALR Police.

      <div class="card span-6">
        <h3>What if I feel unsafe?</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Trust your instincts. Move to a safer area, contact campus safety, and reach out to staff.
          If it’s immediate danger, call 911.
        </p>
        <div class="tip">
          Tip: It’s better to be “extra safe” than to ignore warning signs.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card span-12">
        <h3>What does my RA help with?</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          RAs help with community building, conflict mediation, support during difficult situations,
          and connecting you to campus resources. If something is outside my role,
          I’ll help you find the right office/person.
