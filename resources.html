          The CARE Team has been a great outlet for me personally. I wasn’t always the best at planning
          or scheduling, and they helped me get organized and better understand my syllabus and expectations.
        </p>

        <p class="muted">
          They also connected me to resources I didn’t even know existed — things like grants,
          laptop programs, and campus support services. Sometimes it’s just helpful to have someone check in
          and make sure your strategies are actually working.

          Counseling Services are available if you need someone to talk to or support with stress, anxiety,
          or personal challenges.

          Last semester as a commuter student, my car stopped working on campus.
          DPS came out, helped coordinate towing plans, and allowed me to keep my vehicle
          in the parking deck until the tow arrived.
        </p>

        <p class="muted">
          That showed me DPS isn’t only for emergencies — they also help students stay safe
          during unexpected situations.

          If you game or want to connect a TV/console, the regular Wi-Fi didn’t work for me at first.
          I was sent to the official IT guide that walks you step-by-step through connecting devices properly.

          Following that guide made setup smoother and saved a lot of frustration.

          This is one of the biggest academic resources I’ve used.
          As a STEM major, I was there consistently for help with my math courses.

        <p class="muted">
          The tutoring setup includes graduate students in the library until around 5 p.m.
          They’re knowledgeable, approachable, and great at breaking concepts down.
        </p>

        <p class="muted">
          I recommend going regularly instead of waiting until exams or finals.
